I have developed a web-based application that facilitates Aadhar card registration by users through a user-friendly form. Upon submission, the system generates a unique 16-digit UID for each user and displays their information on a digital Aadhar card.

## Objectives Achieved:

### Form Design and Development: 

Implemented an intuitive form capturing essential user details.

### UID Generation: 

Developed a mechanism to generate a unique 16-digit UID for each user without utilizing the Math.random() method, ensuring uniqueness and handling potential collisions.

### Aadhar Card Design:

Designed a professional and easy-to-read digital Aadhar card displaying user information and UID.

### Display the Aadhar Card:

Successfully displays the Aadhar card with user details upon registration and UID generation.

### Testing:

Thoroughly tested the application to ensure all functionalities worked as expected, including consistent uniqueness in UID generation.
